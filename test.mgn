# Simulated telemetry traffic generator using MGEN
# To start traffic, run: mgen input test.mgn

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Traffic Flow ID 1:
# - Starts immediately at time 0.0 seconds
# - Uses UDP
# - Sends from source port 5555
# - Sends to destination 127.0.0.1:4000 (local receiving app)
# - PERIODIC [10 4000] means:
#     → Send 1 packet every 10 ms  → 100 packets/sec
#     → Each packet is 4000 bytes in size
#
# Therefore:
# - Total bandwidth ≈ 4000 bytes * 100 packets = ~400,000 bytes/sec (≈ 400 KB/s)
# - This simulates continuous telemetry traffic at ~400 KB/s

# Turn off Flow ID 1 after 600000 seconds (~166 hours)
# For practical purposes, this keeps the traffic flowing for the full test duration
